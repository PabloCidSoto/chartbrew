# Chartbrew Frontend

## Structure

```
|-- .eslintrc.json
|-- package.json
|-- semantic.json                   # semantic build settings
|-- config                          # Webpack, jest, etc config files
|-- public                          # Contains the entry index.html file
|-- scripts                         # React scripts (build, run, etc)
|-- src
    |-- actions                     # Redux actions
    |-- assets                      # Any assets (images and stuff)
    |-- components                  # React (dumb) components that should be re-usable
    |-- config                      # various config files with globals, colors, misc functions
    |-- containers                  # React smart components (usually pages that contain multiple components)
    |-- reducers                    # Redux reducers
    |-- semantic                    # semantic files
        |-- dist                    # The distribution generated by the semantic build
        |-- src                     # Currently only the globals are tracked by Git - this sets certain styles for the semantic distribution
        |   |-- site
        |   |   |-- globals
        |   |       |-- reset.overrides
        |   |       |-- reset.variables
        |   |       |-- site.overrides
        |   |       |-- site.variables

```

## How this works

If you never used [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) before, it's strongly recommended to run a [quick-start](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/quick-start) before attempting to modify anything in the front-end.

The main point on future developments will be to always develop with the [props down, events up](https://jasonformat.com/props-down-events-up/) mentality. In Chartbrew this means that a container should send the props to a component and the component can call any events that were passed down by the container. The events will run in the parent component.

**The new components should be functional and use [React Hooks.](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)**

::: warning
Currently, the containers are quite huge and some components are not as dumb as they should be. This will be improved with future updates.
:::

## Example

The following example will create a dummy container with a component, reducer and action.

### Actions

The actions are placed in the `actions/` folder.

```javascript
// actions/brew.js

import { API_HOST } from "../config/settings";

export const FETCHING_BREW = "FETCHING_BREW"; // this is the type of action, used for identification
export const FETCHED_BREW = "FETCHED_BREW";

export function getBrew(id) {
  return (dispatch) => { // dispatch is used to send the action to the reducer
    const url = `${API_HOST}/brew/${id}`;
    const method = "GET";
    const headers = new Headers({
      "Accept": "application/json",
    });

    dispatch({ type: FETCHING_BREW });
    return fetch(url, { method, headers }) // like in the backend code, Promises are preferred
      .then((response) => {
        if (!response.ok) {
          return new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(response.statusText));
        }

        return response.json();
      })
      .then((brew) => {
        dispatch({ type: FETCHED_BREW, brew }); // dispatching the action together with the payload
        return new Promise((resolve) => resolve(brew));
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(error));
      });
  };
}
```

### Reducer

The reducers are placed in the `reducers/` folder and registered in the `index` file there.

```javascript
// reducers/brew.js

import {
  FETCHING_BREW,
  FETCHED_BREW,
} from "../actions/brew";

export default function brew((state) = {
  loading: false,
  data: {},
}, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case FETCHING_BREW:
      return { ...state, loading: true };
    case FETCHED_BREW:
      // remember the "brew" payload dispatched from the action
      return { ...state, loading: false, data: action.brew };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

Don't forget to register this reducer in the `index.js` file in the same folder.

### Component

This will be an example component to show the name and flavour of the brew and a simple button with an event attached.

```javascript
// components/BrewCard.js

import React from "react";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";
import { Header } from "semantic-ui-react";

function BrewCard(props) {
  const { brew, mixBrew } = props;

  return (
    <div style={styles.container}>
      <Header>{{brew.name}}</Header>
      <p>{{brew.flavour}}</p>
      <Button primary onClick={mixBrew}>
        Mix the Brew
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}

const styles = {
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
};

BrewCard.defaultProps = {
  mixBrew: () => {},
};

BrewCard.propTypes = {
  brew: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
  mixBrew: PropTypes.func,
};

export default BrewCard;
```

### Container

This will be a page showing the BrewCard component after getting calling the `getBrew` action.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";
import { connect } from "react-redux";
import {
  Segment, Header, Dimmer, Loader,
} from "semantic-ui-react";

import { getBrew as getBrewAction } from "../actions/brew";

function BrewPage(props) {
  const { getBrew, brew, loading } = props;
  const [mixed, setMixed] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    getBrew(1);
  }, []);

  // container functionality should be prepended with a '_'
  const _onMixBrew = () => {
    setMixed(true);
  };

  if (loading) {
    return (
      <div style={styles.container}>
        <Dimmer active>
          <Loader />
        </Dimmer>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div style={styles.container}>
      <Header attached="top" as="h2">The Brew</Header>
      <Segment raised attached>
        <BrewCard brew={brew} mixBrew={_onMixBrew} />

        {mixed && (
          <Message positive>
            <p>The brew is mixed</p>
          </Message>
        )}
      </Segment>
    </div>
  );
}

const styles = {
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
};

BrewPage.propTypes = {
  getBrew: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  brew: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {
    brew: state.brew.data,
    loading: state.brew.loading,
  };
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    getBrew: (id) => dispatch(getBrewAction(id)),
  };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(BrewPage);
```

## Styling

Chartbrew is using Fomantic UI as the CSS framework. This is a community maintained version of Semantic UI which is not really maintained anymore. 

[The react components usable within Chartbrew can be found here.](https://react.semantic-ui.com)

For any changes to the general feel of the site you can modify Sematic's global variables in `src/semantic/src/site/globals`. You can check out the theming docs on [Fomantic's website](https://fomantic-ui.com/usage/theming.html).
